1. Installation
===============================================================================
The plugin is only one file. So you can check out the repository[1][4] and drop
boot.vim into your directory.
~/.vim/pack/*/start/
for Vim, or 
~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/*/start/
for Neovim.

If you'd like to change the loading sequence:
if ! exists('g:boot_loaded')
    let boot_load_path = g:plugin_dir . '/pack/*/start/boot/autoload/boot.vim'
    execute "source " .   boot_load_path
    execute "runtime! " . boot_load_path
endif
The g:plugin_dir is the plugin installation path. 
Such as ~/.vim or ~/.local/share/nvim/site
The '*' should be your plugin/package manager name

2. Compatibility
===============================================================================
boot.vim uses some shell-isms. Therefore it probably only works on *nix
machines that have a proper shell. It likely also functions under cygwin.

3. Development
===============================================================================
Pull requests are very welcome.

Some updates, with the goal of minimizing interaction and configuration. 
Basic functionality out of the box.
